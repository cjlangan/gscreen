The first file is `copy-path` and by default contains `FALSE`. If set to `TRUE` it will load the path of the file into the clipboard before it takes the screenshot. If set to `AFTER` it will save the path to the clipboard after the screenshot. 

The second file is `screenshot-path` it determines the path where the screenshots are saved. The default is `$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots`.
